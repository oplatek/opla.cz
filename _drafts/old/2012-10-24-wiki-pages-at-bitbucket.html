I like bitbucket.org but using the wiki according the guide is not as smooth as I hoped.  In the guide-default wiki you are advised to do https clone: <pre><br />https://bitbucket.org/username/project-name.git/wiki<br /></pre> Then git push origin master does not work as you probably wanted and ask from obvious reason for password and login.  However if you clone via ssh it works pushing works well. So first do. <pre><br />git clone git@bitbucket.org:UserName/project-name.git/wiki<br />git push origin master # will use your ssh key<br /></pre>
