<ul> <br/><li><br/>Why to version your settings? Because they broke, are complex and sometimes you do not know where the bug is.<br/></li><br/><li><br/>Why git? Could handle merge conflicts the best way among all version systems as far as I know.<br/></li><br/><li>Why GitHub or Bitbucket(my case-free private repos)? <br/>Because you can get your settings and update it among different workstations.</li><br/><li><br/>How to link different settings of your file system? <strong>Finally link to the <a href="http://www.silassewell.com/blog/2009/03/08/profile-management-with-git-and-github/">tutorial</a></strong>.<br/></li><br/></ul><br/><br/><strong>Remark:</strong> I do include into the config repository only the most important files. For example Eclipse contains all settings in one directory ($HOME/.eclipse for standard installation), so I take advantage of that and create classical git repository there.
