With faster computer, which can handle smoothly Eclipse and all its plugins, I discovered new useful tools. Suddenly, a world of fast intellisense and Debugging, sending selected text to REPL window appeared to me!<br/><br/>It is as smooth as F# repl window in Visual Studio and I have to admit that quite simple setting with<br/>well written manual at <a href="http://pydev.org/manual_101_root.html">Pydev website</a> let me try it in few minutes.<br/><br/>Nice!
