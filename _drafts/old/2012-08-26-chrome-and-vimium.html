<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5925220/make-chrome-less-distracting-with-vimium-and-these-settings">About Vimium shortcuts</a> One thing I missed was Vimperator undo tab by "u" In chrome it is Ctrl+Shift-T  also Ctrl+W close tab works better than Vimiums x (because in insert it does not work)  TODO Open Vim from edit box.  I want probably something like http://www.listary.com/text-editor-anywhere Not like TextAid, because I do not want to set up server.
