<p>So far I have been using PyDev plugin in Eclipse for Python debugging. Since Eclipse is not my cup of tea and installing every time I need it is pain, I decided to learn pdb and try out winpdb. </p> <p>Very clear tutorial  for pdb is at  <a href="http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/" >http://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2009/09/10/debugging-in-python/</a>. </p> <p>After pdb I really enjoyed pretty cool interactive multiplatform <strong>winpdb</strong> debugger with copy paste installation. Download it at  <a href="http://winpdb.org/download/">http://winpdb.org/download/</a>. (For GUI there is a wxPython dependency.) </p>
