Explaining my OSS work to Marianka and Jindra.


Once upon a time, there was this [SGE](https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE) old bunch of code which was a little rusty.
[Very few people understand SGE's behaviour](https://github.com/son-of-gridengine/sge/issues/8) and [it's moods](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sungridengine).
Let's image that SGE is a commander in the world of computerrs.
In fact, SGE is commander for a lot for other programs in his realm of dedicated cluster of machines.
He is battle-tested, efficient, and free to serve.
SGE knows his skills and performs it efficiently, and reliably when you persuade him to work for you.

Now come the trouble with SGE, as it is old and most of his loyal servants and maintainers died (or moved on), nobody trully understands SGE anymore.
Do not get me wrong, SGE is still very useful.

Let me pause here with SGE, we have another character to introduce.
