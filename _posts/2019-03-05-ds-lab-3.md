## Homework

1. (2 points) Implement your own dialogue state tracker using any means:
    - Submit the result to your fork of [ds-dstc2 repository](https://gitlab.com/ufal/dsg/ds-dstc2)
    - Calculate F1 and accuracy
    - Dialogue State Tracker is evaluated after each turn
    - Evaluate the slots provided for you: `food area price_range`
    - BONUS points for exceptional models/efforts: e.g. RNN, CNN models in TensorFlow/Pytorch and results about 60% in accuracy
    - BONUS compare scores on ASR hypothesis vs gold hypothesis vs ASR hypothesis which takes into account ASR score.
2. (1 point) Write down alternative responses from a chit-chat system and evaluate performance of such system.
    - E.g. write a unit-test computing BLEU score
