### Content

- A quick review of dialogue state tracking homeworks

- A short intro to [ParlAI](http://parl.ai)
    - ParlAI is a framework for dialogue tasks and dialogue models, with a lot of them already implemented, but actually missing a lot of what we care about the most – task-oriented systems
    - ParlAI is built by facebook and mostly working under Torch, but Tensorflow can be used, too

- Options for longer group projects (to replace both weekly homeworks and semester projects for the future)
    - **Dialogue state tracking** – [RNNs/CNNs with a lot of gates by Ramadan et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.06517.pdf) – we will probably want to simplify this model
    - **NLU** – [different NN architectures (CNN, attention, RNN) by Gupta et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08268) and/or [attention + pointer nets by Zhao & Feng](https://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2068)
    - **Unsupervised NLU** – [clustering dialogue intents and slots without labeled data by Shi et al.](https://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1072)
    - **End-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems** – [seq2seq with attention for knowledge base queries by Wen et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04441.pdf)

- Introduction of several datasets that we could possibly use – multi-domain datasets that are more complex than DSTC2.
    - **[MultiWOZ](http://dialogue.mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/index.php/corpus/)** – multi-domain dataset for city information (was used in the state-tracking paper mentioned above)
    - **[KWRET](https://nlp.stanford.edu/blog/a-new-multi-turn-multi-domain-task-oriented-dialogue-dataset/)** – in-car dialogues about weather, scheduling, and navigation
    - **[MS Dialogue Challenge](https://github.com/xiul-msr/e2e_dialog_challenge)** – reservation dialogues for movie tickets, restaurants, and taxis


## Homework

1. (3 points) Put DSTC2 and your tracker (from Week 3 homeworks) into ParlAI:
    - [Install ParlAI](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_quick.html)
    	- note that for me, their `setup.py develop` failed, but `pip install –user -e .` worked (“install in-place”, which allows importing the modules but you can still edit them)
    - Insert the [DSTC2 data](https://gitlab.com/ufal/dsg/ds-dstc2) as a new [ParlAI task](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_task.html)
    - Adapt your tracker into a [ParlAI agent](https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_seq2seq.html) that gets user input and outputs the current state (a simple string composed of values for food, price, area)
    - (? BONUS points) Choose one of the other datasets (see above) and add it as another ParlAI task. You may even try retraining your tracker on it.

2. (O points, but be sure to do it so we don't decide without you ;-)) Have a look at the papers for group projects and decide which of the tasks you like the most. We will discuss them in more detail in the next lab; we can also go over any points you find unclear.
