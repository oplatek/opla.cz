## Content

- Great homework submission! Thanks!
    - [Simon's solutions](https://gitlab.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/will/dialogove-systemy/tree/master/01)
	- [Vojta's solutions](https://github.com/srdecny/diasys/tree/master/hw1)
    - Python & nice code style is a common practice!
    - Deadline Tue 7 AM - so I can review the solutions before next class
    - Unit-tests why?
    - Kaldi & Slurm experience
    - Phonetic examples walk-through
    - Submission formats: github.com or compressed folder
- Barge-in
    - Examples
    - How to detect it? Audio/word/semantic/pragmatic level?
    - Voice Activity Detection (VAD) vs Wake words
        * speaker diarization
        * adaptive echo cancellation
    - End-pointing and hesitations
- Meaning abstraction
    - opinionated stance
    - words, sentences
    - speech acts: assertive, directive, commissive, expressive, declarative
        - Look at [DSTC2 dataset](http://camdial.org/~mh521/dstc/)
- Actions
    - replies
    - API calls
        - to a database, robot, banking system, etc.
        - should we use APIs? - interface vs self-awareness
        - Lisa Feldman Barrett makes a self-awareness / need for body point in the [Aritificial General Intelligence Podcast by Lex Fridman](https://youtu.be/qwsft6tmvBA?t=3411)
          - I recommend to watch/listen all episodes in this [podcast](https://lexfridman.com/ai/) :)

- Maxims - is it hard?
    - M. of quantity – don’t give too little/too much information
    - M. of quality – be truthful
    - M. of relation – be relevant
    - M. of manner – be clear
- Grounding and dialogue recovery
- Entropy
    - Definition $$ H(text) = - \sum_{x \in \mbox{text}}{\frac{freq(x)}{len(\mbox{text})} log_2(\frac{freq(x)}{len(\mbox{text})})} $$
        - Simplification - Find it!
    - Cross-entropy and LM
        - $$ H(p, q) = -\sum_{x}{p(x) log_2(q(x))}  $$
        - $$ H(text, LM) = -\sum_{x \in text}{ 1/N * log_2(LM(x))}  $$
* n-gram Language models -- see a detailed description by Jurafsky & Martin [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf)


## Homework

1. (1 point) Implement entropy calculations and compute the entropy for the following datasets:
    - [DSTC2 dataset](http://camdial.org/~mh521/dstc/)
    - [Facebook babi tasks 1-6](https://fb-public.app.box.com/s/chnq60iivzv5uckpvj2n2vijlyepze6w). See [github](https://github.com/facebook/bAbI-tasks) for details.
    - [All the news](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news) - use just the "Article Content"
    - Use at most first 10,000 utterances/sentences if the dataset is large.
    - Describe in 5 sentences the properties of each dataset and explain how they relate to the computed entropy value.
2. (2 point) Train a Language Model and compute cross entropy on the [Vystadial dataset](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0023-4670-6)
     - Recommended toolkit - [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm)
         - Read the README and train a model `bin/lmplz -o 5 <text >text.arpa` on the Vystadial training set.
         - Compute cross-entropy of the train, dev set and first sentence from dev set. See the [example usage](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm/blob/master/python/example.py)
         - Describe and explain the results in 5 to 10 sentences.

3. BONUS (3 points) Train a wake word model and evaluate it with your voice!
    - Recommended model: [Mycroft precise](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise)
        - [Quickstart](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise/wiki/Training-your-own-wake-word#how-to-train-your-own-wake-word)
    - Write a short summary of what you did and what problems you have faced.
    - Include your dataset with your source code.
    - Include values of [F1 measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) on the training, development and test set.
4. BONUS (3 points) Write a conditional language model using RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks).
    - Conditional language model is a decoder RNN with the initial state initialized with (i.e. conditioned on) additional information.
    - Run the conditional language model on user inputs from the DSTC2 dataset.
    - Use the previous dialogue state (or a part of it) as the initialization for your conditional language model.
    - Compare the perplexity of a vanilla RNN (zero-initialized) and your conditional implementation on the user inputs.
