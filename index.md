## Academic Career
I am PhD student in the group of [Ondřej Dušek](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-dusek) working on and funded by the [ERC NG-NLG project](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/ng-nlg). 
I also won the [GAUK project for (Evaluating) Conversational Speech Synthesis](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/ecss).
My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks.
I am working on <strong>automatic evaluation</strong> of open-ended(chat) and task-oriented(ToD) <strong>dialogue systems</strong>,
Natural Language Generation(<strong>NLG</strong>), and <strong>conversational</strong> speech
synthesis(<strong>TTS</strong>).

## Industry Career
Please, check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrejplatek/) for details but the TL;DR is I love working with
start-ups but I had also wonderful time during my paid internships at Apple in Cupertino.
I am used to working remotely, but I think it is necessary to meet other team members in person.
In my opinion, meeting once a week for a day is the minimum for a fruitful collaboration.
Alternatively, meeting for two weeks every 6-8 weeks is also viable option.

## Why to work with me?
- I am researcher with deep understanding of the NPL and Speech Processing field.
- I have experience not only as researcher: I built a house, lead several small teams, was a ski-instructor a floorball coach, climbed few peaks, and few sandstone towers, enjoy start-up live in several startups, and I enjoy spending time with my kids and my [wife](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ad%C3%A9la-pl%C3%A1tkov%C3%A1-87390283/).
- I have learned to pay attention not only to the core algorithms, software architecture, but also including the user experience design into account.
- I am Linux expert user and happy MacOS, iOS, Android user.
- I like to write about my projects and I love to open-source them.
- I like to work in team. I can lead and I can follow.
- I prefer to work with my clients long-term. The record is 9 years (2014-2023).

## Why not to work with me?
- I am expensive: 100 Euro/hour for consultation on topic of my expertise -- See above! 50-100 Euro/hour for long-term/open-source/positive-impact projects.
- I am not expert on XY latest AI product.
  I have expertise in applied research&development: I have a good knowledge of algorithms, research literature, and open-source libraries.
  I am not interested in details of closed-source APIs since I cannot improve them.
  However, I typically monitor the best solutions and compare their quality to open-source libraries. E.g., we compared [ChatGPT vs LLama 2 for Chat Evaluation.](todo link arxiv published 2023-08-21).
- I prefer typically mid- or long-term collaborative projects.
  The projects I tend to work on are simply too complex to tackle alone quickly.
  A focused team of 2-6 people works best.
  For projects under 6 months, I am willing to work alone, but I prefer to work in team long-term.
- I don't do dirty tricks and I communicate transparently.

## The Not So Brief Personal History
Originally, back at high school, I was happy focusing on learning German, English and was deeply interested in politics.
I was participating with my [high school](https://gymvod.cz) in [European Youth Parliament](https://eyp.org/). Our team
won its place in [Nyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyon).
However, I also met a lot of researchers, hackers and programmers and just before graduation I decided that coding is much more fun than politics.
I wanted to build things. 
At the beginning, I had no idea what I signed up for.
I still remember how I was searching for tilde sign during my first lab in the first week of the first semester.

Continue writing this not so brief history is continuous process, so stay tuned :).
