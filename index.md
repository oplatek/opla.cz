## Academic Career
I am PhD student in the group of [Ond≈ôej Du≈°ek](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/ondrej-dusek) working on and funded by the [ERC NG-NLG project](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/ng-nlg). 
I also won the [GAUK project for (Evaluating) Conversational Speech Synthesis](https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/grants/ecss).
My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks.
I am working on the <strong>automatic evaluation</strong> of open-ended(chat) and task-oriented(ToD) <strong>dialogue systems</strong>,
Natural Language Generation(<strong>NLG</strong>), and <strong>conversational</strong> speech
synthesis(<strong>TTS</strong>).

## Industry Career
Please check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrejplatek/) for details.
TL;DR is I love working with startups.
However, I also had a wonderful time during my paid internships at Apple in Cupertino.
I am used to working remotely, but I think it is beneficial to meet other team members in person.
Meeting once a week for a day is the minimum for a highly effective collaboration.
Alternatively, meeting for two weeks every 6-8 weeks anywhere in Europe is also viable.
I am based near [Sedlƒçany](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedl%C4%8Dany), and commuting to [Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague) once or twice a week works well for me.

## Why work with me?
- I am a researcher with a deep understanding of the NPL and Speech Processing field.
- I have experience not only as a researcher: I built a house, led several small software teams, was a ski instructor, and a [floorball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floorball) coach.
  Climbed [a](https://eu.zonerama.com/homedik/Album/7373646) [few](https://eu.zonerama.com/homedik/Album/6517857) [peaks](https://eu.zonerama.com/homedik/Album/6886499) and [a few sandstone towers](https://eu.zonerama.com/homedik/Album/4385809).
  I have enjoyed culture in several startups and still enjoy spending time with my kids and [wife](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ad%C3%A9la-pl%C3%A1tkov%C3%A1-87390283/).
- I have learned to pay attention not only to the core algorithms and software architecture but also to consider the user experience design.
- I am a Linux expert user and happy MacOS, iOS, and Android user.
- I love to open-source my projects and to contribute to other projects.
- I enjoy working in a team. I can lead, and I can follow.
- I prefer to work with my clients long-term. The record is nine years (2014-2023).

## Why not work with me?
<!-- - I am expensive: 100 Euro/hour for consultation on a topic of my expertise -- See above! I take 35-70 Euro/hour for long-term/open-source/positive-impact projects. I openly admit that in Czech academia, I earn only a fraction of that. -->
- I am not an expert on XY's latest AI product.
  I have expertise in applied research development: I know the core algorithms, research literature, and open-source libraries well.
  I am not interested in the details of closed-source APIs since I cannot improve them.
  However, I typically monitor the best solutions and compare their quality to open-source libraries. E.g., we compared [ChatGPT vs. LLama 2 for Chat Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06502).
- I typically prefer mid- or long-term collaborative projects.
  The projects I work on are simply too complex to tackle alone quickly.
  A focused team of 2-6 people works best.
  I am willing to work alone for projects under six months, but I prefer to work in a team long-term.
- I don't do dirty tricks, and I communicate transparently.

<!-- ## The Not-So-Brief Personal History -->
<!-- Back in high school, I was happy focusing on learning German and English and was deeply interested in politics. -->
<!-- I was participating with my [high school](https://gymvod.cz) in the [European Youth Parliament](https://eyp.org/). Our team -->
<!-- won its place in [Nyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyon). -->
<!-- However, I also met a lot of researchers, hackers, and programmers, and just before graduation, I decided that coding is much more fun than politics. -->
<!-- I wanted to build things. -->
<!-- In the beginning, I had no idea what I signed up for. -->
<!-- I still remember how I was searching for the tilde sign during my first lab in the first week of the first semester. -->

<!-- Writing this not-so-brief history is a continuous process, so stay tuned :). -->
