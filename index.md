## Hi! I am Ondra, Ondřej, oplatek, oplatk.

## Academic Career
I am PhD student in the group of Ondřej Dušek working and funded by the [ERC NG-NLG project](todo). 
I also won the [GAUK project for (Evaluating) Conversational Speech Synthesis](todo).
My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for speech and language tasks.
I am working on <strong>automatic evaluation</strong> of open-ended(chat) and task-oriented(ToD) <strong>dialogue systems</strong>,
Natural Language Generation(<strong>NLG</strong>), and <strong>conversational</strong> speech
synthesis(<strong>TTS</strong>).

## Industry Career
Please, check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ondrejplatek/) for details but the TL;DR is I love working with
start-ups but I had also wonderful time during my paid internships at Apple in Cupertino.
I am used to working remotely, but I think it is necessary to meet other team members in person.
In my opinion, meeting once a week for a day is the minimum for a fruitful collaboration.
Alternatively, meeting for two weeks every 6-8 weeks is also viable option.

## Why to work with me?
- I am researcher with deep understanding of the NPL and Speech Processing field.
- I have experience not only as researcher: I built a house, lead several small teams, was a ski-instructor a floorball coach, climbed few peaks, and few sandstone towers, enjoy start-up live in several startups, and I enjoy spending time with my kids and my [wife](todo link ada's linkedin).
- I have learned to pay attention not only to the core algorithms, software architecture, but also including the user experience design into account.
- I am Linux expert user and happy MacOS, iOS, Android user.
- I like to write about my projects and I love to open-source them.
- I prefer to work with my clients long-term. The record is 9 years (2014-2023).

## Why not to work with me?
- I am expensive: 100 Euro/hour for consultation on topic of my expertise -- See above! 50-100 Euro/hour for long-term/open-source/positive-impact projects.
- I am not expert on XY latest AI product. I have expertise in applied research&development: I have a good knowledge of algorithms, research literature, and open-source libraries. I am not interested in details of API best use of proriatery technology - despite I typically evaluate and compare their quality to open-source libraries. E.g. [ChatGPT vs LLama 2 for Chat Evaluation](todo link).
- I prefer typically mid- or long-term collaborative projects. The projects I tend to work on are simply too complex to tackle alone. The team of 2-6 people works best. For projects under 6 months, I am willing to work alone.
- I don't do dirty tricks and I communicate transparently.

## The Not So Brief Personal History
Originally, back at high school, I was happy focusing on learning German, English and was deeply interested in politics.
I was participating with my [high school](https://gymvod.cz) in [European Youth Parliament](https://eyp.org/). Our team
won its place in [Nyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyon).
However, I also met a lot of researchers, hackers and programmers and just before graduation I decided that coding is much more fun than politics.
I wanted to build things. 
At the beginning, I had no idea what I signed up for.
I still remember how I was searching for tilde sign during my first lab in the first week of the first semester.

Continue writing this not so brief history is continuous process, so stay tuned :).
